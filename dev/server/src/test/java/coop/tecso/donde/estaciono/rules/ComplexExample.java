* fields are present in xml file <li>how to force xstream to set a default

    * There is one major flaw in XStream. Unfortunately it has no way of
    * telling if a field or attribute should get any default value if not
    * present in the xml file. Because constructor is not being invoked we
    * cannot set the value there. Neither setting the value in field definition
    * will work. The resulting instance will always have zero or null values in
    * the fields.
    *
    * The only way of setting the desired default value is using the following
    * method. It is called during deserialization process and here we can check
    * if the field value is null. If yes it means that it's tag is not present
    * and we can set the default value if needed.
